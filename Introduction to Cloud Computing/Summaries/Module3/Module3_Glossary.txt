Module 3 Glossary: Components of Cloud Computing
Term

Definition

ACL

Access Control Lists

AZ

Availability Zones are distinct Data Centers with their own power, cooling and networking resources. These Zones can have names like DAL-09 or us-east-1.  

Bare-metal hypervisor

Installed directly on top of the physical server. They're more secure, have lower latency, and are usually the ones you see in the market the most

Block storage

Is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fiber connections, which means that read and write speeds are typically much faster and reliable than with file storage

CDNs

Content Delivery Networks is a distributed server network that delivers temporarily stored, or cached, copies of website content to users based on the user’s geographic location

Cloud Region

A geographic area or location where a Cloud provider’s infrastructure is clustered, and may have names like NA South or US East

Containers

Are an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere, whether it be on desktop, traditional IT, or the cloud

Data center

A huge room or a warehouse containing cloud infrastructure

Dedicated hosts

Offer single-tenant isolation

Direct Attached storage

Or Local storage is storage which is presented directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the same rack

File storage

Is typically presented to compute nodes as ‘NFS Storage’. NFS stands for Network File System and means that the storage is connected to compute nodes over a standard ethernet network

Hosted hypervisor

There's a layer of host OS between the physical server and the hypervisor. These hypervisors are less frequently used and mostly used for “end-user” virtualization

HPC

High-performance computing

Hypervisor

A piece of software that runs above the physical server or host

IOPS

Input/Output Operations Per Second and refers to the speed at which the disks can write and read data

NFS

Network File Storage

Object storage

Storage not attached to a compute node, rather it is accessed via an API

Reserved virtual server

Instances allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments

SDN

Software Defined Networking

Shared or Public Cloud VMs

Are provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes

Transient or Spot VMs

Take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center

Virtualization

Process of creating a software-based or virtual version of something whether that be compute, storage, networking, servers, or applications

VLANs

Virtual Local Area Networks

VM

Virtual machines are software-based computers, based on virtualization technologies

VPC

Virtual Private Cloud

VPN

Virtual Private Networks
